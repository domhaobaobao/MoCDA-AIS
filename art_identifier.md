MoCDA - AIS - identifier convergence
------------------------------------

- The identifier of an artwork in the MoCDA collection **MUST** support an open and interoperable approach.
- The identifier **SHOULD** be mutable in the global context, but **WONT** be mutable within a subcontext (e.g. the Ethereum network).
- The identifier **MUST** be invalidated in the context of provenance when it migrates to another context.
- The identifier framework **MUST** support cross context verifications of provenance and authenticity.
- The identifier **SHOULD** enable AIS' and affiliated art market's parters to exercise a collaborative consensual reinforcements of provenance and authenticity.
- The identifier **MUST** support all existing approaches and formats (e.g. NFT).
- The identifier **SHOULD** offer a standard guideline towards interoperability. As it embraces preexisting solutions it should also serve as example of how AIS thinks the industry should evolve.
- The identifier **COULD** support version variations as new technology becomes available and opportunities arise.
- The identifier **COULD** optionally use a semantic namespace that indicates it's origin. This is particularly suitable for registered artists.
- The identifier **SHOULD** act as the entry point to access additional metadata of an artwork. This is expected to disclose additional information on demand (e.g. a condition report or KYC) via consensual access control.
- The identifier **SHOULD** support discoverability via keyworkds on associated metadata.
- The identifier **COULD** contain a reputation score computed consensually within the affiliated trusted organisations.
